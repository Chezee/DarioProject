# DarioProject

This is a test project made by Illia Horevoi

I've made it in 4 hours. Main goals was to build 2 screens with minimum functionality but I decided to focus on not trivial representing of same screens.
Here you can see representing of Home screen with small amount of data such as: Min/Max temperature, icon, Name of the city and description of weather. All the data from OpenWeatherMap.

At right top corner you can switch between Celsium and Fahrenheight system

On tap on any city cell you will go to next screen with map (MapKit/Apple maps)

Technologies used: SwiftUI, Combine, MapKit, SPM, Brain

Minimum iOS Version: 15.0
