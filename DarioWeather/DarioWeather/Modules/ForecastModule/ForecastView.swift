// Here has to be 'Deitals screen' for each city. I decided to focus on main page and make it better with some features.
// Was trying to polish the code to provide not features but quality
// I think it would be trivial to represent another screen which would be almost the same as Home screen

    var body: some View {
        Text("City View")
